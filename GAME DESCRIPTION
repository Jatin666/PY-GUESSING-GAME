Git Project Name : Py Number Game 
Guess The Number 
Write a programme where the computer randomly generates a number between 0 and 20. The user needs to guess what the number is.
If the user guesses wrong, tell 
them their guess is either too high, or too low. This will get you started with the random library if you haven't already used it.
